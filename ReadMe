Angular incorporated a combination of TypeScript (TS), ExpressHTML and Bootstrap and JavaScript (JS) to properly create the Front End of the Travlr web application. This architecture on the front end made it easy to pass and modify data through the application. ExpressHTML allowed the connection between the HTML page and the TS file, which was determined the functionality for the page. The HTML code would be able to talk to the functionality TS code and the TS code would talk to the API. Bootstrap is a way of giving a page a grid layout so that the page can be responsive to different screen dimensions. 
	The backend operated on the MongoDB data base. This data base incorporates JSON and JS for the functionality and data manipulation. JSON is a format that is used for the database. JSON used value pairs and data types to organize the data. JS will make calls to the Mongoose schema which makes calls to the JSON code in the data base. The methods JS uses for the data are get, post, put and delete.
